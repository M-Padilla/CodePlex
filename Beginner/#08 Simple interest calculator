#Challenge for 13/Apr/2020
#Create a program to calculate simple interest on a price
#Take principal (the price), Rate of Interest and the time period in years as float inputs
#The interest will be equal to the product of the inputs divided by 100. Then print the interest amount and the total amount


principal, interest_rate, time= float(input('Enter principal: ')), float(input('Rate of interest in %: ')), float(input('Enter time in years: '))

interest_ammount= principal * (interest_rate/100) * time
total_ammount= principal * (1+(interest_rate/100)* time)

print('The ammount corresponding to interest is:', "${:,.2f}".format(interest_ammount))
print('The total ammount is:', "${:,.2f}".format(total_ammount))
