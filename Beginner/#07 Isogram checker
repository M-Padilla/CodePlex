#Challenge for 09/Apr/2020
#Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.
#An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.
#Examples of isograms:
#
#    lumberjacks
#    background
#    downstream
#    six-year-old
#
#The word isograms, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.


def isogram_checker(entry):
    #The following regex ignores the letter-case, then selects a character in the range a-z '([a-z])' and looks over any character
    #any number of times '.*' until it finds another occurrence '?' of the previously selected character '(\1)'.
    result = re.search(r"([a-z]).*?(\1)", entry, re.IGNORECASE)
    if result==None:
        return True
    else:
        return False
        

import re

entry=input('Enter word or phrase: ')
if isogram_checker(entry)==True:
    print('It is an isogram!')
else:
    print('Not an isogram.')
