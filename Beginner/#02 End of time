# Challenge for 4/Apr/2020
#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.
#For example, if an event starts at 12:17 and lasts 59 minutes, it will end at 13:16.
#Don't worry about any imperfections in your code - it's okay if it accepts an invalid time - the most important thing is that the code produce valid results for valid input data.

#Test Data
#Sample input:
#12
#17
#59
#Expected output: 13:16

#Sample input:
#23
#58
#642
#Expected output: 10:40


hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

end_hour = (hour + ((mins + dura) // 60)) % 24
end_mins = (mins + dura) % 60

print(end_hour,":",end_mins)
