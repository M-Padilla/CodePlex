#Challenge for 16/Apr/2020
#Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
#The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:
#On every year that is evenly divisible by 4
#except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
#unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400
#For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
