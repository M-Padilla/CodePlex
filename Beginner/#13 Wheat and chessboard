#Calculate the number of grains of wheat on a chessboard given that the number on each square doubles.
#There once was a wise servant who saved the life of a prince.
#The king promised to pay whatever the servant could dream up.
#Knowing that the king loved chess, the servant told the king he would like to have grains of wheat.
#One grain on the first square of a chess board, with the number of grains doubling on each successive square.
#There are 64 squares on a chessboard (where square 1 has one grain, square 2 has two grains, and so on).
#Write code that shows:
#How many grains were on a given square, and
#the total number of grains on the chessboard


certain_square=input('Enter the square number you what to find how many grains did it contain: ')

print('There were',f"{2**(int(certain_square)-1):,}",'grains in the square',certain_square)
print('Total grains:',f"{2**(64)-1:,}")
