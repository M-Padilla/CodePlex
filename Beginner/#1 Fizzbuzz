#Challenge for 3/Apr/2020
#Let's start with a quick and easy challenge few of you might already have done.
#It's a common question for job interviews and it's called fizzbuzz
#Write a programm that gets an integer input. 
#If the input is a multiple of 3 the output should be fizz,
#if it's multiple of 5 the output should be buzz. 
#If it's a muliple of 3 and 5 the output should be fizzbuzz. 
#Every other input stays the same.

number = int(input('Enter the number: '))
if number%3 == 0 and number%5 == 0: 
  print('fizzbuzz') 
elif number%3 == 0:
  print('fizz') 
elif number%5 == 0:
  print('buzz')
else:
  print(number)
