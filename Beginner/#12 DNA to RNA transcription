#Challenge for 17/Apr/2020
#Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
#Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
#The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
#The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
#Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
#    G -> C
#    C -> G
#    T -> A
#    A -> U

def rna_transcription(dna_sequence):
    #The .translate method maps simultaneously some strings to other strings.
    #The .maketrans method sets the mapping: The first argument are the strings to be replaced,
    #and the second one are the replacement strings.
    #The replacement order follows the order in which each character in the string appears.
    rna=dna_sequence.translate(str.maketrans('GCTA','CGAU'))
    return rna

sequence=input('Enter DNA sequence: ')
print(rna_transcription(sequence))
