#Challenge for 17/Apr/2020
#Given a DNA strand, return its RNA complement (per RNA transcription).
#Both DNA and RNA strands are a sequence of nucleotides.
#The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).
#The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).
#Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
#    G -> C
#    C -> G
#    T -> A
#    A -> U

    rna=dna_sequence.translate(str.maketrans('GCTA','CGAU'))
    return rna
