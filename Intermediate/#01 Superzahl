#Challenge for 04/Apr/2020
'''
The player chooses 6 different numbers out of 49.
A player wins the jackpot when he got all 7 numbers right. Pretty easy to understand I think.
So now that's the task:
Get user input: 6 numbers from 1 to 49, each number can only be chosen once!
1 'Superzahl' from 0-9
The program: Gets User Input only once!
Should generate 6 different random numbers from 1-49(each number is only allowed once per draw)
1 'Superzahl' from 0-9
After each draw output the numbers which where the same as the user Input.
Make as many random draws as needed to win with the  user input!
Accumulate all draws needed and tell the player how many tries he needed
(how often he would have to play with the numbers chosen to be exact)
and how much it would have costed(price per draw is 1,25 CryptoSchekel)
