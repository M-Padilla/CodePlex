Challenge for 09/May/2020

There are 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.

You and your fellow cohort of those in the "know" when it comes to binary decide to come up with a secret "handshake".

1 = wink
10 = double blink
100 = close your eyes
1000 = jump


10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.

Given a decimal number, convert it to the appropriate sequence of events for a secret handshake.

Here's a couple of examples:

Given the input 3, the function would return the array ["wink", "double blink"] because 3 is 11 in binary.

Given the input 19, the function would return the array ["double blink", "wink"] because 19 is 10011 in binary.
Notice that the addition of 16 (10000 in binary) has caused the array to be reversed.

def handshake(number):

    bnum = bin(number) #Convert to binary string in the form 0bX, where is the binary number
    
    bnum = bnum[bnum.index('b')+1:] #Get the binary number by slicing to the left of the 'b' part of the above string
        
    handshake_options = ['wink','double blink','close your eyes','jump']
    secret_handshake = []

    if len(bnum) == 5:  #If the binary contains a position value in the tens of thousands (10000)
        handshake_options.reverse() #Flip the order of handshake options
        bnum=bnum[1:] #Focus on the remaining positional values.

    for pos,digit  in enumerate(bnum):
        if digit == '1': #Retrieves the handshake option corresponding to the positional value
            secret_handshake.append(handshake_options[pos])

    return secret_handshake
       
while True:
    num=int(input('Input an integer number to get the secret handshake: '))
    if (num <= 0 and num > 31) or (num == 16): 
        #If the number is higher than 31 (bin 11111) or lower than or equal to zero, 
        #you can't use the specific handshake as defined in the function)
        #If the number is 16 (bin 10000) you won't do anything at all
        print('Enter a valid number for the handshake')
    else:
        print(handshake(num))
        break
