Challenge for 19/Jun/2020

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. 
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, 
and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. As an example, 
here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

def fibonacci_generator(terms):
    series = [0,1]

    for term in range(terms - 2):
        series.append(series[-1] + series[-2])

    return series



result = fibonacci_generator(100)
